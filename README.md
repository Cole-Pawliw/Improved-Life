# Improved-Life
Conway's Game of Life made using the Godot game engine. 

I woke up and decided this would be fun to make, so I threw it together in a couple of hours. Draw whatever shapes or patterns you want, then start the game to see your simulation play out. You cannot draw while the game is live, and the upper right corner provides useful information. The game updates every 0.25 seconds by default, with a minimum of 0.05 second update time.

Controls:
- Left Click (hold): draw cells
- Right Click: toggle draw/erase mode
- Space or Enter: play/pause game
- W or Up Arrow: increment update time by 0.05s
- S or Down Arrow: decrement update time by 0.05s

I made a similar project in high scchool without an engine and using a text-based interface. This is obviously a much improved version of that, because I wanted to try my hand at it again.
